- I want to find someone who understands coding to create a website&app that simple terms upload an mp3 or wav file and it loads it to all major platforms via account conectivivty.
- 2nd is finding a way to keep it add free-possibly via record label funding and big corp funding... idk or just super low yearly cost of 19.99 USD.
- Also the ablilty to for all record lables companies to enteract via one platform. People who create sound packs or drum kits, too people who create finished or unfinished sample music.
- being able to book djs around the world give flight information, itineraries, and much more at the ease of clicking an app.
